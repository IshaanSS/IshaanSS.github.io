                    <p>The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu) is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain. 
                        With a current seating capacity of 83,168, it has the second-largest seat capacity in Spain, and it has been 
                        the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.

                        Named after footballer and legendary Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu (1895–1978), 
                        the stadium is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of 
                        the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010. The stadium 
                        also hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals, making Santiago Bernabéu the first 
                        (and only) stadium to host the two most important premier continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores).
            
                        The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup were also held at the Bernabéu, 
                        making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA Euro final and a FIFA World Cup final.
